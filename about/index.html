<h1>Who am I really?</h1>
<p>I am a technology enthusiast with wide range of experience in IT field,
  both in employments and personal hobbies.
  Born in Lahti-city in late April of 1990,
  I graduated from high school of Lahden Yhteiskoulu and moved to study at
  Aalto University in Otaniemi, Espoo.
  Currently,
  I live with my veterinarian wife in {{ site.address-city }}.
  When I manage to have some freetime
  I build and fix electronics and work with my personal coding projects,
  play some PC games, or get jumpy with parkour or gymnastics.

<h2 id="studies">Studies and degrees</h2>
<p>
  I graduated from Aalto University's school of Electrical Engineering
  with major in Automation and Control Engineering master's program in summer 2022.
  <br>
  I made my bachelor's thesis about <i>Offline Programming of Industrial Robots</i> with excellent grades.
  My bachelor's degree included also a variety of courses in Computer Science,
  so I constructed the minor of my master's studies from Software Engineering courses.
  My master's thesis topic was
  <a href="https://github.com/Amatson/thesis/blob/main/out/thesis_main.pdf">
    <i>Machine learning approach to support ticket forecasting from software logs</i></a>,
  which gave me basic skills and ongrowing interest in machine learning and cloud computing.
  <br>
  Automation and control engineering studies gave me comprehensive mathematical skill set
  to be utilized in all sorts of programming tasks.
</p>
<h2 id="skills">What am I good at?</h2>
<p>
  My main interest is in user oriented programming and service design.
  Decades working as fast food restaurant employee, church camp volunteer
  and student union representative made me very social and compassionate person.
  Thus, my strength is in understanding other people and solving the issues they might have.
  I have utilized this skill successfully when selling overall badges of my own design in different student events.
  <br>
  What I have learned in my employments and studies, is that people rarely understand what they really need.
  They might have an idea of the problem they are facing and what they want to fix it,
  but they might not realize what the best solution could be.
  Interpreting the real problem and "selling" the actual solution to their problem is where I shine.
  <!--{#
    Creating a website has been a blast as I have learned to use HTML with CSS, Django, Jekyll and Javascript.
    I'm currently not only hosting these pages but also creating Django-based version under my own domain.
    Web project has also inspired me to improve my Python skills and required some finger-dipping into more lower level web features
    like HTTP protocols and domain maintenance. I also got quite good with
    Linux when setting up my own media server to run Plex, Subsonic and Transmission behind a VPN client. #}-->
  <br>
  I'm quick to learn new skills and get exited when I get to try out novel technologies.
  My interest has widened from small microcontroller projects to my own Ubuntu media/game/web server hosting.
  Writing scripts and developing gadgets for personal use is everyday life for me.
  These skills have been useful in my work over the years.

  <!--{# I have earlier experience in C, C++ and C# programming. Especially C++
   comes in use with microcontroller projects. I have also some experience with
   Java coding as it is needed in Android programming. Learning how to make
   Android applications was also useful because it required lots of
   understanding about usability issues. The main thing I have learned from
   usability is that if user interface is poorly designed, the program itself
   is practically useless. The <span title="User Experience">UX</span> is
   something I wish to be able to improve in any subject I work on.#}-->
