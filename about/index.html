<h1>Who am I really?</h1>
<p>I was born in late April of 1990 in Lahti-city, the Chicago of Finland.
  After high school of Lahden Yhteiskoulu I started my studies in
  Aalto University at Otaniemi, Espoo. I live with my veterinary
  student fiancée in Jyväskylä. When I manage to have some freetime
  I build and fix electronics and work with my personal coding projects,
  go to gym, play Pokemon Go or get jumpy with parkour.

<h2 id="studies">Studies and profession</h2>
<p>
  I am a student in Aalto University's school of Electrical Engineering and studying Automation and Control Engineering. I made my bachelor's thesis about Offline Programming of Industrial Robots with excellent grades. My bachelor's degree also included a variety of courses in Computer Science.
  <br>
  Currently, I'm working on my masters degree with Computer Science and Software Engineerin in main focus without forgetting the already finished major courses in Control, Robotics and Automation.

<h2 id="skills">What am I good at?</h2>
<p>
  My main interest is now in user oriented programming <span class="rainbow">in all its colors.</span> Creating a website has been a blast as I have learned to use HTML with CSS, Django, Jekyll and Javascript. I'm currently not only hosting these pages but also creating Django-based version under my own domain. Web project has also inspired me to improve my Python skills and required some finger-dipping into more lower level web features like HTTP protocols and domain maintenance. I also got quite good with
  Linux when setting up my own media server to run Plex, Subsonic and Transmission behind a VPN client.
  <br>
  I have earlier experience in C, C++ and C# programming. Especially C++
  comes in use with microcontroller projects. I have also some experience with
  Java coding as it is needed in Android programming. Learning how to make
  Android applications was also usefull because it required lots of
  understanding about usability issues. The main thing I have learned from
  usability is that if user interface is poorly designed, the program itself
  is practically useless. The <span title="User Experience">UX</span> is
  something I wish to be able to improve in any subject I work on.
